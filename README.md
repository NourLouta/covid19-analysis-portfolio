# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Analysis

This is a data analysis and visualization project using real COVID-19 case data from April 2020. The notebook demonstrates a full data science workflow — from loading and cleaning raw data, to feature engineering, answering key business questions, and presenting insights with professional visualizations.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand the global distribution of COVID-19 cases by country/region.
- Analyze confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery rates.
- Engineer new features like mortality and recovery rates.
- Visualize trends using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Export meaningful outputs and generate a reproducible portfolio project.
